## Hi there 👋


Welcome to the GitHub page of iScience from Uni Konstanz! 

Find our dropR tool for analyzing and visualizing dropout as a [Shiny App](https://iscience-kn.shinyapps.io/dropR/).
You can also use it as its own package - read all about it in the [vignettes](https://iscience-kn.github.io/dropR/index.html).

<!--
**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
